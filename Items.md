# This is my research on how items are placed in maps, and how the MSB files are linked to the ItemLotParam.

First of all, the ItemLotParam contains many information about how items are placed into maps.
The main columns we will focus on are: ID / ItemLotId01 / ItemLotId02 / getItemFlagId

So to make this easier, I will showcase an example.

We will be using the Saw Hunter Badge which its item ID is 4110 (100E).
So if we go to that ID in the ItemLotParam, we can see that it has this information:
  
  **•ID: 2410290
  
  **•ItemLotId01: 4110
  
  **•ItemLotId02: 0
  
 **•getItemFlagId: 52410290
  
Now if you notice, the getItemFlagId is the same as ItemLotId01 but with an extra 5 at the beginning. This is normal for most of the items but there are some items that has it different. In that case, we use the getItemFlagId.
